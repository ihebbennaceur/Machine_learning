## Company's Description 📇
Walmart Inc. is an American multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores from the United States, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas. The company was founded by Sam Walton in 1962.
## Project 
Walmart's marketing service has asked you to build a machine learning model able to estimate the weekly sales in their stores, with the best precision possible on the predictions made. Such a model would help them understand better how the sales are influenced by economic indicators, and might be used to plan future marketing campaigns.

## Goals
**Part 1 : make an EDA and all the necessary preprocessings to prepare data for machine learning**

**Part 2 : train a linear regression model (baseline)**

**Part 3 : avoid overfitting by training a regularized regression model**

# Deliverable 
Create some visualizations

Train at least one linear regression model on the dataset, that predicts the amount of weekly sales as a function of the other variables

Assess the performances of the model by using a metric that is relevant for regression problems

Interpret the coefficients of the model to identify what features are important for the prediction

Train at least one model with regularization (Lasso or Ridge) to reduce overfitting
