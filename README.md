# Machine_learning (3 Projects )

## Project 1 : Supervised machine learning 

**project name is Conversion Rate**
we will be using ML models to make classifications and some challanges to get which models gives us better performances 
## Project 2 : Supervised  machine learning

**project name is Walmart sales**
in this project we will build a model able to estimate the weekly sales .we will use regression models and we will avoid overfitting (LASSO -RIDGE)

## Project 3 : Unsupervised machine learning
**Project name is Uber Pickups **
we will two unsupervised algorithms (KMeans and DBScan ) to find hot zone  and describe it for a specific day/time of the week

## In the next folders we will explain more details about the projects
